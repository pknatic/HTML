## What Is C ?
C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell Labs. It is a high-level programming language that is used to develop a wide range of applications, including operating systems, device drivers, embedded systems, and software applications.<br>C is a `procedural` programming language, which means that it follows a step-by-step approach to solving problems. It is a compiled language, which means that the source code is converted into machine code by a compiler before it is executed.<br>C is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability. It is a widely used language in the field of computer science and engineering, and is often taught as a first programming language to students due to its simple syntax and powerful features.
## How To Make An Environment To Run C Codes

## Getting Started With C

##### **Alphabets** : 
C supports both uppercase and lowercase alphabets, including A to Z and a to z.<br>
##### **Numbers** :
C supports both integer and floating-point numbers. Integer numbers can be positive or negative. Floating-point numbers can have decimal points and can have a wider range of values.<br>
##### **Special-Symbols** :
C supports a wide range of special symbols, including +, -, *, /, %, =, ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, &, |, ^, !, ~, &&, ||, ++, --, ?:, <<, >>, (), [], {}, ;, :, ,, ., ->, #, and //.<br>
It is important to note that some special symbols have a special meaning in C, such as the semicolon (;), which is used to end statements, and the hash symbol (#), which is used for preprocessor directives. Therefore, it is important to use these symbols appropriately in your code.
##### Constants,Variable And Keywords :
A constant is an entity that doesn't change,whereas, a variable is an entity that may change. A keyword is a word that carries a special meaning. In programming languages, constants are often called literals, whereas variables are called identifiers. Let us now see what different type of constants and variables exist in C.
